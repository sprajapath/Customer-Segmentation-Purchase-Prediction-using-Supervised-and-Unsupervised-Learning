# Customer-Segmentation-Purchase-Prediction-using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning

Customer Segmentation + Purchase PredictionProject OverviewThis capstone project demonstrates the application of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Scikit-learn. The goal is to provide a dual-analysis approach: predicting specific tumor classifications and grouping similar patient samples to identify underlying patterns.ObjectivesSupervised Learning: Build a predictive classification model to determine if a tumor is Malignant or Benign.Unsupervised Learning: Apply clustering to group similar tumor samples based on their numerical characteristics.Interactive Deployment: Create a Gradio interface within Google Colab to allow users to test real-time predictions and cluster assignments.DatasetThe project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes:Samples: 569 Features: 30 numerical characteristics (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter) Target Labels:0: Malignant 1: Benign Methodology1. Supervised Learning (Classification)Model: Logistic Regression.Pipeline: Data is processed through a StandardScaler to normalize features before being passed to the LogisticRegression classifier.Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports (precision, recall, and F1-score).2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)Algorithm: KMeans Clustering.Optimization: The optimal number of clusters ($K$) is determined by computing silhouette scores for values between 2 and 7.Visualization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the 30-dimensional feature space into 2D for visual cluster plotting.3. Application DevelopmentA Gradio interface is integrated to provide a "deployment-style" experience. Users can input tumor feature values and receive:A predicted class (Malignant/Benign) from the supervised model.A cluster group assignment from the KMeans model.Tools & Libraries UsedLanguage: Python Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, Logistic Regression, KMeans, PCA) Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn Web App: Gradio How to RunOpen the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.Run the cells to install necessary libraries (specifically !pip install gradio).Execute the training cells to build the models.Launch the Gradio app link generated at the end of the notebook to interact with the models.
